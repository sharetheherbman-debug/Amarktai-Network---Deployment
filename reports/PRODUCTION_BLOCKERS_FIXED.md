# Production Blockers Fixed - January 2026

## Summary
All critical production blockers have been resolved. The system is now stable, real-time, and deploy-ready on Ubuntu (nginx + systemd).

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. SHOW/HIDE ADMIN FUNCTIONALITY (Asked 9 times) ✅
**Status:** FULLY RESOLVED

**Changes:**
- Chat command handler now properly case-insensitive and whitespace-tolerant
- Commands: `show admin`, `showadmin`, `hide admin`, `hideadmin` all work
- Password prompt implemented (Ashmor12@)
- Backend endpoint `POST /api/admin/unlock` properly called
- Admin state persisted to `sessionStorage` (not localStorage for security)
- Auto-switches to admin section when showing
- Auto-switches away from admin section when hiding
- Clear success/failure feedback messages in chat
- Admin nav item only shows when `adminVisible=true`

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js` (lines 875-955)

**Testing:**
```bash
# In chat, type any of these (case-insensitive):
show admin
SHOW ADMIN
Show Admin
showadmin

# Enter password: Ashmor12@
# Admin panel should appear and automatically switch to admin section

# To hide:
hide admin
HIDE ADMIN
hideadmin
```
